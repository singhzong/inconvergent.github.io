  <h1>Fractures</h1>

  <p>Fractures is in many ways similar to both <a href="#hyphae">hyphae</a> and
    <a href="#network">network</a>. The process is described in more detail in
    <a href="/generative/fractures">this section</a> of my <a
      href="/generative">text on generative algorithms</a>.</p>

  <h1>Differential Line</h1>

  <p>The Differential Line [<a
    href="https://github.com/inconvergent/differential-line">github</a>]
  algorithm is inspired by the way a number of biological things in nature
  grows. Among other things it is made to mimic the growth of the human brain,
  as well as a great number of plants. In brief; we start of with a number of
  connected nodes in a circle. Gradually we introduce new nodes on the
  line—prioritizing segments where the curve bends more sharply. Over time the
  curve grows increasingly intricate, but it never self-intersects.</p>

    <p>If we start with a different shape, and draw the outside position of the
    object for each growth step, we can get an entirely different kind of
    system. This system shares the 3d like illusion created by the <a
      href="http://inconvergent.net/#orbitals">Orbitals</a> algorithm.</p>

  <h1>Differential Surface</h1>

  <p>Differential Surface [<a
    href="https://github.com/inconvergent/experimental-surface">github</a>] is
  a three dimensional implementation of the same ideas (more or less) that
  inspired the <a href="#differential">Differential</a>
  algorithm, which I wrote a while back.</a></p>

  <p>The faces of the mesh are affected by their neighboring faces over
  time—rejecting non-neighboring faces that are too close, and keeping a
  comfortable distance to their actual neighbors. The surface is gradually
  remeshed to account for it's growing surface area.</p>

  <p>Another interesting addition to this system is to let the system grow
  towards an imagined nutrition source, or light source, of some kind. This
  results in strange fungi-like objects.</p>

  <h1>Orbitals</h1>

  <p>Orbitals [<a
      href="https://github.com/inconvergent/orbitals_speedup">github</a>] is
    inspired by the naive optimization process that <a
      href="http://complexification.net">Jared Tarbell</a> has implemented in
    his "<a
      href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/happyPlace/index.php">Happy
      Place</a>" algorithm. Nodes are created in some, more or less structured
    arangement, before they start to make friends with their neighbors.
    Gradually the nodes make an effort to get closer to their friends, whilst
    at the same time keeping a comfortable distance from the nodes they have
    not befriended.  The visualization is made by drawing lines betweeen pairs
    of friends as they walk around the canvas. Thus the final image is a
    history of all the friendships.</p>

  <h1>Meshx</h1>

  <p>Meshx [<a href="https://github.com/inconvergent/meshx">github</a>] is my
    first attempt at a three dimensional generative algorithm. The algorithm
    can grow from any number of seeds; either along another surface geometry,
    or freely in any direction. The algorithm grows by choosing random
    triangles on the surface of the structure and appending a triangular
    pyramid to that face. This gives the resulting geometry a ragged-looking
    appearance. I had no particular biological process in mind when I wrote
    this algorithm, but it turns out that it creates structures that look a lot
    like corals.</p>

  <h1>Tree</h1>

  <p>One of the first attempts I made at generative algorithms was a copy of <a
      href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/treeGarden/">this</a>
    great little application. Recently I decided it was about time that I
    revisited this project, and below are a few of the results. As opposed to
    the algorithm in the link, my trees are generated pixel by pixel. That is,
    there are no pre-drawn parts. [<a
      href="https://github.com/inconvergent/tree">github</a>] </p>

  <p>As you can see, if you examine the images a little, the trees take shapes
    that er neither realistic nor possible. Yet they look very much like trees
    at first glance.</p>

  <p>The background is another algorithm of mine called <a
    href="#linetrace">Linetrace</a>.</p>

  <p>Differential Mesh [<a

  extension of the <a href="#hyphae">Hyphae</a> algorithm.  I started working
  on it with the intention of mimicking the growth of (certain types of)
  lichen. The results, to me, are equal parts crystal-like and biological.</p>

  <h1>Hyphae</h1>

  <p>Hyphae [<a
      href="https://github.com/inconvergent/hyphae_ani">github</a>] is an
    algorithm I wrote in an attempt to mimick the growth of roots. You can see
    a video of how the algorithm grows <a
      href="http://youtu.be/IMVEs4o4-GI">here</a>. The algorithm centers around
    letting circles grow "next to each other" in such a way that no two circles
    overlap. The results are incredibly intricate and fractal-like, and they
    can be tweaked in a great number of ways.</p>

  <p>After watching John Franzen drawing his incredibly fascinating "<a

    One Breath</a>" drawings, I wanted to try doing somthing similar using
  code. After many failed results, I also ended up with a few versions I rather
  liked. They can hardly be said to behave in the same way as Franzen's
  drawings, as was the initial goal, however I find them equally
  interesting.</p>

  <p>At some point I stumbled upon this great <a style="color:#555"

  by Adam Runions et al. I have since spent some time replicating the algorithm
  itself, as well as trying to recreate the behaviour in other ways. As usual
  some of the results are similar, whereas others ... not so much.</p>
