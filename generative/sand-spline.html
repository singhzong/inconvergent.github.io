  <p>Sand Spline was an idea I almost discarded because it seemed like it would
    not yield interesting results. However, I gave it a shot, and I was very
    pleased with the results almost right away.</p>

<div class="text">
  <p>The idea is based on the concept of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline">B-splines</a>. In
    mathematics a B-spline is a smooth spline that is drawn from a number of
    nodes (control points) without necessarily passing through the nodes
    themselves. If you move the nodes a little, the smooth curve will follow
    along. And if you make the nodes move little by little at random, the
    spline will gradually become more erratic. You can see this in the
    animation below.  </p> </div>

  <p>In this animation the spline starts on the right and moves
    counter-clockwise. You will also notice that the level of noise is larger
    the further out along the spline we go. This has nothing to do with the
    spline itself, but it is a nice way to keep the starting node in its
    original position.</p>

  <p>Instead of simply drawing the spline, I draw a series of transparent dots
    along the spline for every iteration. I also make sure to draw the same
    number of dots each time, regardless of the length of the spline. Since the
    movement is gradual, you will get high density where the spline moves
    slowly, and lower density where the spline moves quickly.

    This behaviour, and painting technique, is in many ways similar to several
    Tarbell works, including <a
      href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/sandDollar/">Sand
      Dollar</a>, <a
      href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/limbsandstroke/">Limb
      Sand Stroke</a>, <a
      href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/sandTraveler/">Sand
      Traveler</a> and <a
      href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/sandstroke/">Sandstroke</a>.
    Hence the name. As several people have pointed out to me these images are
    also very reminiscent of the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system">Lorenz Attractor</a>,
    even though the method is rather different.

  <p> Combining this simple method with different configurations of splines and
    colours gives a large number of quite different results, and I will
    probably return to this system to experiment frequently.  </p>
