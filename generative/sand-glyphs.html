  </h2>

  <p>After publishing a few <a href="../sand-creatures">Sand Creatures</a>
    result several people suggested I try to make font. I haven't actually
    tried to do this yet, but I have tried various methods of making a
    cursive-like script by concatenating multiple <a
      href="../sand-creatures">sand creatures</a> from the previous section. As
    you can see below, even very simple combinations of sand creatures can
    produce rather pleasing <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asemic_writing">asemic writing</a>.
  </p>

  <p>To get an idea of how it works, you can look at the image below, where the
    control points are highlighted.</p>

<div class="text-img">
  <img
    src="/img/generative/sand-glyphs-detail.jpg" alt="sand glyphs"
    title="sand glyphs"/></a>
</div>

<div class="text">

  <p>There are a number of things to play around with even in this simple
    configuration:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The number of control points per glyph;</li>
    <li>distance between the glyphs;</li>
    <li>shape of the glyphs;</li>
    <li>position of the glyphs relative to the horizontal center line;</li>
    <li>internal order of the control points in a glyph;</li>
    <li>number of glyphs to a word;</li>
    <li>how the script wraps into lines;</li>
    <li>and so on …</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Not to mention that all of these things assume a left-to-right, more or
    less Latin-like, cursive script.</p>

  <p>You probably get the idea: there are a lot of variations to try. Below is
    an example of one of the configurations that I have been the most happy
    with so far.</p>

  <p>I could go on and post a whole lot of different versions. If you are
    interested in seeing some of them I suggest you have a look at this <a
      href="https://twitter.com/inconvergent/status/767027736141594624">twitter
      thread</a>. It contains various results I have posted when working on the
    algorithm. There is also <a
      href="https://twitter.com/inconvergent/status/769165186863333376">this
      video</a> of my plotter writing out some of the script.</p>

  <p>Finally I'd like to direct your attention to <a
