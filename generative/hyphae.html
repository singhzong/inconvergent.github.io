  <p>I started playing with a system where I grew connected circles that were
    not allowed to overlap. The way it works is that you place a seed node
    (circle) somewhere, and give it a radius and a direction of travel. Then
    you attempt to append a new node to the perimeter of the first node in the
    travel direction.  The important part is that you need the travel direction
    to "wobble" a little, so you perturbe the angle randomly each time. You
    also make sure the radius of new nodes grows a little smaller each time you
    append a new node.</p>

  <p>To get branches you can pick nodes at random and attempt to grow a new
    node more or less perpendicular to the branche's direction of travel.
    Either it collides, or you get a new branch. For interesting effects you
    can make the angle perturbations proportional to the width (radius) of the
    branch. Thicker branches are generally straighter than thin branches. And
    you can obviously do a lot of other things as well. For instance you get
    radically different results if you adjust how much more "flexible" branches
    grow as they grow thinner.</p>

  <p>Another little note is that when a branch branches off from an existing
    branch you should make the radius considerably thinner than the parent
    branch.  You can see this happening all the time in trees. The idea is that
    there should be about as much mass before and after a branch intersection.
    (I read this somewhere, but I can't find the paper it was in.)</p>
