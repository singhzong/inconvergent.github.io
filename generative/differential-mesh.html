  <h2>Differential Mesh

  <p>When I had gotten <a href="../differential-line">Differential Line</a>
    working the obvious next step was to try to create something similar in three
    dimensions; and one alternative is to make the line itself move in
    three dimensions. However, that did not really seem all that appealing. Instead I
    chose to go for a combination of the attraction/rejection behaviour of <a
      href="../differential-line">Differential Line</a>, and the growing behaviour
    of Hyphae. Essentially I wanted to make a (triangular) mesh that grew outward
    without self-intersecting or colliding. Doing this directly in three dimensions
    seemed a little daunting, so I started with a two dimensional version.</p>

  <p>In the animation above you can see that new triangles are added to the
    outside if the existing mesh.  They are added in such a way that they don't
    collide with existing parts of the mesh. I use a very naive collision detection
    where I check if a potential new vertex is too close to any existing vertices
    before adding it. In addition all vertices still behave similarly to the
    vertices in Differential Line; that is, they try to get  as much space around
    themselves as possible, whilst remaining close enough to their neighbors.</p>

  <p>The key thing to get this to work is to have the mesh do various
    self-balancing operations as it grows. There are a few things you can try:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Split edges that are too long.</li>
    <li>Avoid inserting new vertices where the vertex density is too high.</li>
    <li>Flip edges to reduce the length of the edge.</li>
    <li>Add a force that makes the triangles attempt to be roughly
      equilateral.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>The animation above employs a combination of all of these.</p>

  <p>Now we scale down the triangle size and add some structure.</p>

  <p>The hope was that this set of rules would resemble the growth of slime mold
    or, more likely, lichen. It turns out the basic version of this is quite
    similar to certain types of lichens. And it seems to match the growth of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchantiophyta">liverworts</a> as well,
    as was pointed out to me on <a
      href="https://twitter.com/CieraReports/status/621068347430449152">twitter</a>.</p>

  <p>The way I initially controlled the growth was to choose random edges, check
    if they were on the outside if the structure, and see if I could attach a new
    triangle to that edge. The problem with this strategy is that eventually most
    edges are going to be on the "inside" of the structure. This means that you are
    going to spend a lot of resources checking edges that you can't do anything
    with.</p>

  <p>There is a pretty obvious solution to this problem. (And, as usual, when I
    say obvious, I mean that it took me a few months to realize) Instead of picking
    random edges and testing if you can grow a new triangle from it, you can use
    food sources. First you randomly position food sources in the domain.  Then you
    have something happen each time an edge in the structure hits one of these food
    sources. For instance if you let the growth of the mesh spike when a food
    source is hit you get something like this.</p>

  <p>If you let this simulation run for a while you can get a number of
    interesting results. Here is a version where the color of each triangle
    gradually changes according to when it was created. The color changes gradually
    from white to black, then flips instantly back to white again. The first time I
    did this it was an accident, but as you can see it gives it a nice three
    dimensional illusion.</p>
