  <h2>Not a Conclusion</h2>

  <p>This text is still in progress. I hope to gradually post more sections.
    In the meantime, I regularly post things I'm working on at <a
      href="https://twitter.com/inconvergent">@inconvergent</a>. I have also
    started a web shop where I sell drawings made with my mechanical plotters:
    <a href="http://store.inconvergent.net">store.inconvergent.net</a>.</p>

  <p>If you would like to see some more of my work, there are some images in my
    <a href="/gallery">gallery</a>, and some images of significantly better
    resolution over at my <a href="https://ello.co/inconvergent">Ello</a>
    profile.</p>

    of the text that could use improvements.</p>
