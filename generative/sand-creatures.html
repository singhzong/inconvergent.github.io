  <p>When working on <a href="../sand-spline">Sand Spline</a> I got a few
    intermediary results that reminded me of cursive hand writing. Instead of
    directly attempting to make something that looked like writing, I started
    playing with generating small "Sand Creatures".</p>

  <p>I tried a few different things, but what produced the most pleasing
    results was the following procedure:

    <ul>
      <li>Generate several random control points from a uniform distribution
        confined to a sphere.</li>
      <li>Place them in an arbitrary order</li>
      <li>Create a <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline">B-spline</a> from the
        control points in this order.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>In order to add some texture to the shapes I make another spline by
    cloning the first set of control points, and offsetting all of them
    slightly at random. Then I use the previosly mentioned <a
      href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/sandstroke/">sandstroke</a>
    technique to draw straight lines between equally-spaced pints on the two
    splines. This way you get a nice grainy feeling to the "creatures".</p>

    <p>With a few changes you can also get quite different results, like the
      example below.<p>

  <p>The texture on these images would come out much better in a large print.
    Unfortunately, such a print is not available at the moment. Instead you may
    want to have a look at <a

      image</a> of higher resolution, before you move on to the next
    section.</p>
