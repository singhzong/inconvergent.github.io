  <h2>Differential Mesh 3d

  </h2>

  <p>Since <a href="../differential-mesh">Differential Mesh</a> seemed to be
    working quite well I decided to make an attempt at recreating the same
    behaviour in three dimensions. In some sense this is "just" a matter of
    adding a third dimension, and letting things go from there. However, there
    were a few other challenges as well. First of all avoiding collisions is a
    bit more tedious in 3D. Secondly making sure that your mesh is consistent
    is a little more complicated. (I use a variation of the <a
      href="https://www.google.com/search?q=half+edge+data+structure&oq=half+edge+data+structure&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2608j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8">Half-Edge</a>
    Data structure to represent the mesh and all operations on it.)</p>

  <p>Similarly to <a href="../differential-line">Differential Line</a> and <a
      href="../differential-mesh">Differential Mesh</a>, the problem of
    collisions and self-intersections isn't really solved at all here. By
    adjusting the various forces it is possible to get it to behave well enough
    that collision detection isn't needed (most of the time …). Having said
    this, I should also point out that this is the first time I attempt to
    write a generative 3D mesh, so I can guarantee you that there are better
    ways of doing this out there.</p>

  <p>One of those better ways is <a
      href="http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/projects/sets/floraform/">Floraform</a> by
    <a href="http://www.n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com">Nervous System</a>. Another one
    (although strictly speaking not a mesh, as I've understood it) is <a
      href="http://www.andylomas.com/cellularFormImages.html">Cellular
      Forms</a> by Andy Lomas.</p>

  <p>If you want to play with 3D meshes on your own I recommend trying out <a
      href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, which has a complete <a
      href="https://www.blender.org/api/blender_python_api_current/">Python
      API</a>. You can see an example of mine <a
      href="https://github.com/inconvergent/experimental-surface">here</a>. You
    could also try <a href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing</a> combined
    with <a href="https://github.com/wblut/HE_Mesh2014">HE_Mesh</a> by <a
      href="http://www.wblut.com">Frederik Vanhoutte</a>.</p>

  <p>The above image is a rendering of a mesh done in <a
      href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, using the Blender Cycles
    Rendering engine. As you can see it has a rather "frayed" appearance. This
    is a result of the chosen growth strategy: In a manner similar to the food
    source method used to create <a href="../differential-mesh">Differential
      Mesh</a>, the growth of this mesh is controlled by applying the concept
    of "growth intensity". Vertices with high growth intensities will be more
    inclined to move than vertices with lower intensities—which in turn causes
    new vertices to be added to the mesh.</p>

  <p>When we start the simulation certain vertices are given a growth intensity
    of <em>one</em>, whilst the remaining vertices have a growth intensity of
    <em>zero</em>. As the simulation progresses the growth intensity will
    gradually spread to neighboring vertices, similar to how heat spreads
    through a piece of metal.</p>

  <p>To make the mesh grow outwards outside edges of the mesh will be randomly
    assigned a growth intensity of <em>one</em> during the  course of the
    simulation. If we do this assignment in a scattered manner we will get
    frayed meshes such as above.  On the other hand, if we apply the growth
    intensity on the edge more uniformly, we will get results such as in the
    example below.</p>

    one!</p>
