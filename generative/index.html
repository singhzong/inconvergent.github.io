  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>I've always been fascinated with patterns. It doesn't really matter what
    kind of patterns; I've played with networks, leaves and leaf venation,
    branches, <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichtenberg_figure">lightning</a>, <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">flocking</a>, tracing outlines
    of shapes, river formation, rock sediments, landscapes, <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slime_mold">slime mold</a>, lichens,
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system">reaction-diffusion</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular
      automaton</a>, some fractals, and a few other things. I think what I
    enjoy the most is how complex and intricate results you can get from a set
    of simple rules.</p>

  <p>Recently I've been particularly interested in biological patterns, and
    differential growth. My background is in numerical mathematics, not
    biology. So I have limited knowledge of how biological systems actually
    work. Even so, I've been experimenting quite a lot with recreating various
    biological behaviours. Part of the challenge is to try to recreate some
    pattern or behaviour with as few and as simple rules as possible.</p>

  <p>Sometimes I manage to recreate the phenomenon I set out to create, and
    sometimes not. More often than not I get something interesting, even if it
    is not always what I expected.</p>

  <h2>A Confession</h2>

  <p>In the interest of disclosure I should point out that I sometimes base my
    work on the ideas that I have seen done elsewhere by a number of other
    generative artists.  Most notably <a
      href="http://complexification.net">Jared Tarbell</a> and <a
      href="http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/">Nervous System</a>. For instance the
    algorithm I named <a
      href="https://github.com/inconvergent/orbitals">Orbitals</a> (image
    below) is very heavily based on <a
      href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/happyPlace/">Happy
      Place</a> by Tarbell.</p>

<div class="text">

  <p> I point this out because I have always found it hard to know where a
    piece of software—and in my particular case, the images generated by that
    software—is <em>novel</em> enough to be viewed as a separate work.</p>

  <h2>Inconvergent</h2>

  <p>I started working with generative algorithms when I was supposed to be
    studying for my exams at university. For that reason I bought the domain
    name <a href="/">inconvergent.net</a>, as a joke on me diverging from my
    studies. The first thing I did was to copy several of Tarbell's algorithms
    using Javascript/Canvas. After a while I started getting a few other ideas
    of my own.</p>

<div class="text-img" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/VisualArtwork">
  <meta itemprop="name" content="sand creatures"/>
  <meta itemprop="artMedium" content="digital"/>
  <meta itemprop="artForm" content="generative"/>
  <div itemprop="creator" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"/>
    <meta itemprop="name" content="Anders Hoff"/>
    <meta itemprop="sameAs" content="http://inconvergent.net"/>

  <p>Apart from Orbitals, the first algorithm I got working was <a
      href="hyphae">Hyphae</a>. It came to me when I was trying to recreate the
    behaviour of <a
      href="http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/shop/generativeProduct.php?code=99">Hyphae</a>
    by Nervous System. At this point I hadn't realized how complicated that
    algorithm actually is, and I spent way to much time trying and failing to
    get it anywhere near decent. I implemented it later, and you can read the
    <a href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/venation.sig2005.pdf">Siggraph
      paper</a> describing it if you are interested. It is a fascinating
    read!</p>

  <h2>Code</h2>

  <p>I make almost all of my code available at <a
      href="https://github.com/inconvergent">Github</a>. All the following
    sections have a link to the corresponding repository. Unfortunately not all
    of it is entirely well documented or up to date.</p>
