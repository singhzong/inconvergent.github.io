<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I've always been fascinated with patterns. It doesn't really matter what
kind of patterns; I've played with networks, leaves and leaf venation,
branches, lightning, flocking, tracing outlines of shapes, river formation,
rock sediments, landscapes, slime mold, lichens, reaction-diffusion, cellular
automaton, some fractals and a few other things. I think what I enjoy the most
is how complex and intricate results you can get from a set of simple
rules.</p>

<p>Lately however I've been particularly interested in biological patterns, and
differential growth. Since my background is in numerical mathematics, not
biology, I have limited knowledge of how biological systems actually work. Even
so I've been experimenting a lot with recreating various biological behaviours.
Part of the challenge is to have some pattern or behaviour, and try to recreate
it with as few and as simple rules as possible.</p>

<p>Sometimes I manage to recreate the phenomenon I set out to create, and
sometimes not. More often than not I get something interesting, even if it is
not always what I expected.</p>

<h3>A Confession</h3>

<p>In the interest of disclosure I should point out that I sometimes base my work
on the ideas that I have seen done elsewhere by a number of other generative artists.
Most notably <a href="http://complexification.net">Jared Tarbell</a> and <a
  href="http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/">Nervous System</a>. For instance the
algorithm I named <a href="/#orbitals">Orbitals</a> is very heavily based on <a
  href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/happyPlace/">Happy
  Place</a> by Tarbell.
</p>

<p> I point this out because I have always found it hard to know where a piece
of software—and in my particular case, the images generated by that software—is
<em>novel</em> enough to be viewed as a separate work.</p>

<h2>Inconvergent</h2>

<p>I started working with generative algorithms when I was supposed to be
studying for my exams at university. For that reason I bought the domain name
<a href="/">inconvergent</a>, as a joke on me diverging from my studies. The
first thing I did was copying several of Tarbell's algorithms using
Javascript/Canvas. After a while I started getting a few other ideas of my
own.</p>

<p>Apart from Orbitals, the first algorithm I got working was <a
  href="../#hyphae">Hyphae</a>. It came to me when I was trying to recreate the
behaviour of <a
  href="http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/shop/generativeProduct.php?code=99">Hyphae</a>
by Nervous System. At this point I hadn't realized how complicated that
algorithm actually is, and I spent way to much time trying and failing to get
it anywhere near decent. I implemented it later, and you can read the <a
  href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~federl/Publications/Siggraph-2005/">Siggraph
  paper</a> describing it if you are interested. It is a fascinating read!</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>I make a lot of my code available at <a
  href="https://github.com/inconvergent">Github</a>.  Specifically the
repositories for the following mentioned algorithms are: <a
  href="https://github.com/inconvergent/hyphae_ani">Hyphae</a>, <a
