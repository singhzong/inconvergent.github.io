<p>As opposed to the biology inspired Hyphae and tree algorithms, the next
example is based on hand drawings by <a
  href="http://www.johnfranzen.com/art/JOHN_FRANZEN_-_EACH_LINE_ONE_BREATH_-_PAPER_EDITION.html">John
  Franzen</a>. Essentially Franzen draws lines where each line traces the
outline of the previously drawn line. As each hand drawn line will have slight
variations, interesting patterns soon emerge.</p>

<p>Drawing shapes on the computer is fairly straight forward. A line consists of
a number of vertices (points) with an edge (segment) between them. To create a
triangle you need three edges, and you connect them with three vertices. To draw
a circle you do the same thing, but you need sufficiently many vertices to make
it "impossible" to see that it is not actually a circle. If you are wondering:
there are more sophisticated ways of drawing shapes, but this is an easy
one.</p>

<p>This means that drawing these lines the same way that Franzen does can be
done by drawing curvy shapes with many vertices in them. The tracing behaviour
is a bit more tricky, but there are a number of ways you can try. I wanted the
behaviour to mimic how you actually draw the shape little by little, whilst
following the previous path. The algorithm I came up with does not quite work—in
the sense that it does not avoid collisions—but the results look very nice.</p>

<p>To trace the outline you can sample
some of the nearby edges on the previous line, calculate the average direction
of those edges and add a vertex to the current line along that direction. Then
add some random motion to mimic free hand drawing. This seems to work quite
well for a while, but there is some "inertia" that can be seen in the
results—the shape adapts too slowly.</p>

<p>The amount of noise you add to each vertex is crucial. This noise is what
drives the whole system to make interesting shapes since the tracing behaviour
is always forced to attempt to replicate both the general movement and some of
the random jitter as it progresses.</p>

<p>These images don't really scale down well, so I made a somewhat larger one

<p>Next is a somewhat more complex system that also involves lines.</p>
