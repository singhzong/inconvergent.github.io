  <p>When we are on the subject of branches, I figured I could mention this
    similar little thing I wrote.</p>

  <p>I wanted to try to grow branches in a similar way to Hyphae, but have new
    branches only appear on the "tip" of other branches. In addition I don't
    worry about collisions or anything like that in this simulation. The
    results are not quite trees, but they can be rather convincing if you don't
    look very carefully.</p>

  <p>The perhaps most interesting thing to note here is that no tree ever grew
    from the trunk up at fixed width, like these so-called trees do. Trees grow
    both in height and width over time, and it is a very dynamic process with
    loads of factors. Hence this algorithm has very little in common with
    actual trees, but the few naive rules of this algorithm still make a decent
    job of mimicking real life trees.</p>

  <p>To give a nice illusion of depth to the trees I add some shadow to the
    branches as they grow. The illusion is improved further by adding more
    shadow on one side.</p>
