<h2>Fractures</h2>

<p>I've already mentioned <a href="http://www.complexification.net/">Jared
Tarbell</a> in this text, but I will mention him once more still. One of the
first pieces of generative art I ever saw, and took notice of, was Tarbell's <a
href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/substrate/">Substrate</a>.
It's a genius algorithm in all it's simplicity: Lines grow in a particular
direction until they reach the boundary of the domain, or until they collide
with another line. When a line stops, at least one new line is spawned
perpendicularly off of one of the existing lines at an arbitrary position.</p>

<p>Recreating the city-like structures of Substrate is an interesting exercise
in itself. However I wanted to combine (some of) the behaviour of Substrate
with other features of the previously mentioned <a
href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~federl/Publications/Siggraph-2005/">leaf
venation algorithm</a>. The goal was to mimic the fracturing patterns that
occur in brittle materials like glass or porcelain. You might have seen this
yourself if you've been unfortunate enough to drop your mobile phone, or if you
own some <a

tableware</a>. When related to (among other things) paintings these patterns
are referred to as <a

<p>Similar to the method used in the leaf venation algorithm we distribute a
number of sources into the domain. We then start any number of seed fractures.
The following growth steps of these fractures are controlled in the following
way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find all sources within a fracture's field of vision (FOV). Varying the
    field of vision will yield very different resultsâ€”greater FOV results in more
    meandering.</li>
  <li>Calculate the (mass) centre of the sources in the FOV.</li>
  <li>Take a step towards the mass centre.</li>
  <li>We terminate the fracture if it has collided with an existing fracture,
    or if there are no sources in the FOV</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to controlling the growth of the fractures, we need to add new
fractures. The strategy used in the images displayed here is to randomly spawn
new fractures from the tip of the fractures that are currently active (i.e.
have not yet collied with anything). Yet again the frequency of new fractures
will have a major impact on the final result.</p>

<p>If have ever seen a broken phone screen you might have noticed that the
fractures are rarely uniformly distributed: the density of fractures tends to
be greater  near the point of impact.  In order to fake this effect you can
introduce a fracturing speed. As a fracture grows the speed is gradually
reduced. When a fracture is spawn it inherits a fraction (e.g. 0.8) of it's
parent's current speed. In this case the fracturing speed is not used to
control the rate of growth, but rather the rate of spawned new fractures. The
effect looks like in the following image.</p>

<p>I published a few images that display the variation of the fracturing
algorithm on my <a
