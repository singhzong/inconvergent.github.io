  <p>When working on <a href="../differential-line/">Differential Line</a>, <a
      href="../differential-mesh/">Differential Mesh</a> and <a
      href="../differential-mesh-3d/">Differential Mesh 3d</a> the most tedious
    part was managing the data structure. Partly because I decided to try to
    learn to use the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_connected_edge_list">half-edge</a>
    data structure properly in the process. Partly because I failed to do just
    that.  And finally because I was writing it in <a
      href="http://cython.org/">Cython</a>, which was new to me at the
    time.</p>

  <p>Regardless of all of this I got there eventually. However, this process
    also led me to wish for a more loosely connected system. It felt to me like
    such a system would be more easy to manage. I also had the idea that such a
    system could be similar to <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slime_mold">slime mold</a>, in the
    same way that <a href="../differential-mesh/">Differential Mesh</a> is more
    or less recognizable as <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen">lichen</a>.</p>

  <p>With this in mind I started Differential Lattice. Part of the algorithm is
    very similar to <a href="../differential-mesh/">Differential Mesh</a>; it
    consists of connected nodes, and the connected nodes attempt to remain
    close together. It also shares the behaviour where each node tries to avoid
    all non-connected nodes within a certain radius. The important difference
    is that the connections between nodes is re-calculated <em>before every
      iteration</em>. This means that we need nice way of deciding whether
    two nearby nodes should be neighbors or not.</p>

  <p>It turns out that <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_neighborhood_graph">Relative
      neighborhoods</a> work well for this. Relative neighborhoods are
    introduced in the previously mentioned <a
      href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/venation.sig2005.pdf">leaf
      venation algorithm</a>. Somewhat simplified we can say that two nodes are
    relative neighbors if a <em>sufficiently large</em> area between the two
    nodes does not contain any other nodes.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider in this system is how new nodes are introduced. In
  <a href="../differential-mesh/">Differential Mesh</a> new nodes are
  introduced by splitting edges in half. This is one of the somewhat tedious
  processes of a half-edge data structure. Especially if you have stubbornly
  implemented your own version of the data structure, like me. In a loosely
  connected system, such as Differential Lattice, adding a new node is simply a
  matter deciding on a position, introducing the node, and recalculating the
  neighborhoods, as you would in any step of the simulation.</p>

<p>Because of this, the challenge is reduced to deciding where to place the new
  nodes, and how often new nodes should appear. In these examples new nodes
  appear in areas where the local density of nodes is sufficiently low. This
  causes new nodes to largely appear on the <em>outside</em> of the existing
  structure. In a manner somewhat similar to slime mold which is gradually
  growing outwards.</p>

<p>So far this system does not have any kind of food distribution, which is an
  interesting aspect to explore at a later time. E.g. is this simple system
  somehow able to replicate the <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwKuFREOgmo">Tokyo Railway System</a>
  or display other kinds of interesting behaviours?</p>

<p>This system is is implemented using <a
    href="https://documen.tician.de/pycuda/">pyCUDA</a>, which means that all
  distance calculations, and neighborhood calculations can be done on the GPU.
  Because of this it is probably one of the fastest algorithms I have ever
  implemented. It is possible to make systems with hundreds of thousands of
  nodes surprisingly quickly considering the amount of computation
  involved.</p>
