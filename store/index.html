<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Here are a few plots I've made using my Makeblock plotter. All plots were
  made using pigmented and light proof ink on high quality smooth cotton paper.
  Since they have been plotted using a mechanical plotter they all have their
  own little oddities and artefacts.</p>

<p>Please contact me at <a
    href="mailto:inconvergent@gmail.com?Subject=buy-plot">e-mail</a> with
  questions, or if you want to buy a plot.</p>

  <img src="/img/store/head.jpg" alt="head" title="head" />

<p>If you want to buy a plot please include the name of the plot (eg. "Plot
  A"), as well as your full name and address in the e-mail. I will then send
  you the payment details (Paypal). Note that I will not ship the plot until I
  have received they payment in full. <em>All plots include standard shipping
    to anywhere in the world.</em> </p>

<p>The plots will be signed and numbered. All plots below are unique, so they
  are numbered as "1/1".</p>

<p>I have more plots available, so contact me if you are missing something, and
  I might be able to make it available.</p>
