<h1>About</h1>

<p>My name is Anders Hoff. I write algorithms that generate images. To me it is
  fascinating how complex and intricate results you can get from a set of
  simple rules. My works are often a result of me trying to recreate some
  behaviour I have seen elsewhere. Either in nature, in previous works by
  others or in mathematical concepts. On my <a
    href="https://www.facebook.com/inconvergent.net">facebook</a> page I keep a
  worklog, of sorts, where I post ideas and strange results I stumble across. I
  also post quite a lot of pictures on my <a
    href="https://twitter.com/inconvergent">twitter profile</a>, and on <a
    href="http://ello.co/inconvergent">ello</a>.</p>

<p>In addition I make a great deal of my code available at <a
    href="https://github.com/inconvergent">github</a>, but most of my
  repositories are prone to rapid change and broken code. Feel free to contact
  me if you are interested in a particular algorithm, or piece of code, and I
  will make a clean tag for you.</p>

<p>My very informal "CV" can be found at <a

<p>I am best contacted at <a

 <h2>Commissions, Prints and Plots</h2>

 <p><em>I've recently put a few plots (made by a mechanical plotter) up for
     sale.  You can see them at the <a href="/store/">Store</a>.</em></p>

 <p>Most of these algorithms are incredibly flexible, and I would love to
   hear from you if you have a project in mind! Or if you have a really large
   wall that seems kind of empty.</p>
