  <h2>Do you use Procesing?</h2>

  <p>No, nope, nope nope.</p>

  <p>Most of my work is done in a combination of Python and <a
      href="http://cython.org/">Cython</a> with <a
      href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a
      href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> and <a
      href="https://cairographics.org/pycairo/">Cairo</a>. Sometimes with the
    help of Cuda in the form of <a
      href="https://documen.tician.de/pycuda/">pyCUDA</a>.  Occasionally I
    dabble in Javascript and <a href="http://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>.</p>

  <p>The reason for this is mostly that I know Python very well, and that I
    prefer the syntax of Python over <a
      href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>. It is also because the
    availability of useful libraries seem to be somewhat better in Python.</p>

  <p>Having said that, I suggest you use whatever seems pleasant and
    understandable to you. Processing is perfectly suited for doing similar
    work to what you can see on this site.</p>

  <h2>Do you sell your work?</h2>

  <p>Yes, the work I currently sell is available at <a
      href="http://store.inconvergent.net">store.inconvergent.net</a>.</p>

  <h2>Do you share your code?</h2>

  <p>Almost all my code is on <a
      href="https://github.com/inconvergent">Github</a>. Be warned that the
    documentation is sometimes quite lacking ...</p>

  <h2>What background do you have?</h2>

  <p>I have a Master of Science, specializing in Numerical Mathematics.</p>

  <h2>What Mechanical Plotters do you Have?</h2>

  <p> I Have two plotters. An <a href="http://www.axidraw.com/">EMSL
      Axidraw</a>, and a <a
      href="http://www.makeblock.com/xy-plotter-robot-kit/">Makeblock XY
      Plotter</a>. </p>

  <p>The Makeblock plotter is cheaper, and you have to assemble it yourself. It
    also has a larger drawing area. The cons are largely that the software that
    is provided is quite bad, both the firmware on the plotter itself, and the
    control software.</p>

  <p>The Axidraw plotter on the other hand is considerably more professionally
    put together. Both the available firmware and software seems much better,
    and the overall build quality is better. It is however more expensive, and
    the drawing area is smaller.</p>

  <p>All in all both plotters do what they are meant to do, but the bottom line
    is that I recommend the Axidraw.</p>
